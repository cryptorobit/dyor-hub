# üåü DYOR Hub

**DYOR Hub (Do Your Own Research Hub)** is a premier platform for discovering, discussing, and researching tokens in the cryptocurrency space.

## üõ† Architecture Overview

In production, the application uses the following architecture:

- **Frontend**: `dyorhub.xyz` (main domain)
- **API**: `api.dyorhub.xyz` (subdomain)

This separation provides better organization and security compared to using path-based API routing (`dyorhub.xyz/api`).

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Twitter OAuth with session management
- **Session Storage**: Redis
- **Content Moderation**: Google Perspective API
- **Token Data**: Helius API and DexScreener
- **Monorepo Management**: Turborepo

## üìã Requirements

- **Node.js**: v22 or higher
- **pnpm**: v9.0.0 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: v14 or higher
- **Redis**: v6 or higher
