# Team

**DYOR Hub** was created by **Julien Coulaud**, a fully **doxxed developer** ([https://x.com/JulienCoulaud](https://x.com/JulienCoulaud)) with extensive experience in web and crypto. From inception, our mission has been to build an open, transparent, and community-driven platform that makes crypto research more efficient and secure for the Solana memecoins ecosystem.

While Julien leads development, **DYOR Hub is open-source** and benefits greatly from **community contributions**. We welcome feedback and suggestions from our users.
