# Wallet Verification

Connect your wallet to DYOR Hub to unlock more features, verify ownership, and interact with the community.

### Why Connect Your Wallet?

- **Verify Ownership**: Prove you control a specific wallet.
- **Access Features**: Use features available only to token holders or verified users.
- **Enable Tipping**: Let others tip you $DYORHUB via your public profile.
- **Get Team Verification**: Get a "Verified Team" badge if your wallet matches a token's developer address.

### How to Connect

1. Go to [**Account > Wallet Connection**](https://dyorhub.xyz/account/wallet).
2. Click **Connect Wallet**. The site will detect Phantom or other Solana wallets.

### Privacy

- Your wallet address is **private by default**.
- Turn on "Public Profile Visibility" if you want your address shown publicly for tips.

This verification system ensures identity validation while maintaining transparent, verifiable ownership for platform interactions.
