# User Profiles

Every DYOR Hub user gets a **public profile page** showing their activity, predictions, and reputation. Profiles help identify valuable contributors and allow users to follow, tip, and interact.

You can view a profile by clicking a username or going to:
`https://dyorhub.xyz/users/<username>`
