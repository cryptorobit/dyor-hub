# Tipping

Show appreciation for helpful content by sending `$DYORHUB` tokens directly to other users. You can tip insightful comments or user profiles.

### How to Tip

**1. Start the Tip**

Click the **"Tip"** icon below a comment or on a user's profile.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only tip users who have made their wallet public in their profile settings. See [user-profiles.md](user-profiles.md 'mention').
{% endhint %}

**2. Choose the Amount**

A popup will ask how many `$DYORHUB` tokens you want to send. You can:

- Enter a custom amount
- Choose a preset amount (e.g., 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k)

**3. Confirm in Wallet**

Click **"Send Tip"**. Your connected wallet (like Phantom) will ask you to approve the transaction.

**4. Confirmation**

After the transaction succeeds, you'll see a confirmation showing the amount sent and who received it.
