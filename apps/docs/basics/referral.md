# Referral Program

Invite friends to DYOR Hub using your referral code or link. Referrals help grow the community, boost your leaderboard rank, and might earn you rewards during special promotions.

### Get Your Referral Link/Code

Go to **Account â†’ Referrals** to find:

- Your **Unique Referral Code** (5 characters)
- A **Shareable Referral Link** (includes your code)

Share the link or code with friends. When someone signs up using it, they count as your referral.

### Track Your Referrals

The **"My Referrals"** section shows everyone who signed up using your code.

### Using Someone Else's Code

If someone referred you, enter their 5-character code in the **"Referred By"** section and click **"Apply Code."**
