# Leaderboards

DYOR Hub Leaderboards highlight the most active, accurate, and helpful users. They help you see top contributors, track your own stats, and encourage friendly competition.

Leaderboards update in real-time and have been used for **promotions with SOL rewards** (like for top referrers).

There are several leaderboard categories:

### Token Calls

Ranks users on how well they predict token performance. Metrics include:

- **Success Rate**: How often calls are right.
- **Timing Precision**: How close calls are to the target date.
- **Average Return**: Average gain on successful calls.
- **Average Market Cap**: Typical size of tokens called.

**How the Calls Score is Calculated:**

The score uses this formula:

`Score = (Successful Calls / Total Calls) * log(Total Calls + 1)`

- `(Successful Calls / Total Calls)` is the Success Rate.
- `log(Total Calls + 1)` rewards making more calls, but less aggressively than just counting total calls. This prevents spamming low-quality calls to climb the ranks.

This formula balances accuracy (Success Rate) with activity (Total Calls).

### Reputation

A combined score based on all your activity on the platform. High reputation users are often trusted community members.

### Top Referrers

### Posts

Ranks users by the number and quality of their posts.

### Comments
