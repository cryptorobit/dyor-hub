There are two ways to find token details on DYOR Hub:

### Search by Contract Address (CA)

Enter the token's CA in the search bar at the top of the page. This takes you to the token detail page.

### Click on Token Links

Tokens shown on the homepage or in lists (like trending or recent activity) link directly to their detail pages. Click any token name or CA to see its details.

All token references throughout the platform are designed to provide direct access to detailed token profiles.
