# Token Detail Page

Every token listed on DYOR Hub has its own detail page. This page gathers key info, on-chain data, community discussion, and links all in one place.

Here's what you'll find:

### Social Links

Find the token's official links: Twitter/X, Telegram, Discord, Website, etc. This helps you check the project's communication and community activity.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Red Twitter/X Icon**: If the icon next to the Twitter link is red, it means the account has changed its username before. Hover over the icon to see the previous names. This can help spot rebranding or suspicious changes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Website Expiration**: Hover over the website link to see when the domain expires. A domain expiring soon might be a red flag, while a long registration suggests more commitment.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Verified Dev**: If a token's developer has verified their wallet and Twitter/X account with DYOR Hub, you'll see a badge: **"Dev verified: @handle"**. This badge also appears on their comments, helping you identify official posts from the team.

### Bundle Analysis

This section (powered by **Trench.bot**) checks if a large part of the token supply was initially bought by coordinated groups of wallets ("bundles"). This pattern can sometimes indicate a coordinated launch or pump-and-dump risk.

Key Info:

- **Total Bundled %**: What % of the supply was initially bought by bundles.
- **Current Holdings %**: What % of the supply those bundles _still_ hold. **If this is 0%, the token is considered "distributed"**, meaning the initial group likely sold off, which is often a good sign.
- **SOL Invested**: How much SOL the bundles spent initially.
- **# Bundles**: How many distinct groups were detected.
- **# Wallets**: Total wallets involved in the bundles.

A high "Current Holdings %" might suggest risk, as the bundled group could still dump their tokens.
