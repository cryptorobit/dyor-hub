# Calls

Make **Token Calls** on DYOR Hub to predict a token's future price or market cap. Calls are public, timestamped, and tracked automatically, promoting accountability.

This isn't about vague guesses; it's about making specific, trackable predictions.

### How to Make a Call

On any token detail page, click **"Make a Prediction"**. You'll need to set:

- **Target**: Predict the _Market Cap_ or _Price_.
- **Format**: Predict a percentage gain (e.g., +50%), a multiple (e.g., 2x), or a specific target value (e.g., $1M market cap).
- **Timeframe**: When you expect it to happen (e.g., 1 week, 1 month).
- **Reasoning** (Optional): Briefly explain why you're making the call.

### Calls in Community Discussion

Your call appears in the token's **Community Discussion** like a comment, but with special formatting to stand out.

### Call Detail Page

Each call gets its own page with detailed tracking:

This page shows:

- **Chart**: Tracks the price/market cap towards your target over time.
- **Metrics**: Compares the target, starting value, and current status.
- **Timing**: Shows when the call was made and the deadline.
- **Your Analysis**: Your original reasoning (if provided).
- **Outcome**: Clearly marked as success ✅ or failure ❌, with the actual performance multiple (e.g., 2.02x).
- **Interaction**: Others can reply, vote, tip $DYORHUB, or share your call visually on Twitter/X.

These pages make it easy to see how predictions perform and recognize accurate callers.

### Token Calls Explorer

The [**Token Calls Explorer**](https://dyorhub.xyz/token-calls) is a dashboard showing all calls made on the platform. Analyze community-wide accuracy, timing, and performance.

You can view:

Each entry shows:

- **Status** (✅ Success, ⏳ Pending, ❌ Failed)

- **Actual Growth Multiple**
- **Call Timestamp & Deadline**

You can filter by **date range**, **user**, or **token**.

Use the explorer to find successful predictors, track active calls, or see which tokens are getting attention.

### Leaderboard Ranking

Users with consistently accurate calls rank higher on the [**Token Call Leaderboard**](https://dyorhub.xyz/leaderboard?category=tokenCalls&page=1). This highlights reliable contributors and encourages quality predictions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**How the Calls Score is Calculated:**

The score uses this formula:

`Score = (Successful Calls / Total Calls) * log(Total Calls + 1)`

- `(Successful Calls / Total Calls)` is the Success Rate.
- `log(Total Calls + 1)` rewards making more calls, but less aggressively than just counting total calls. This prevents spamming low-quality calls to climb the ranks.

This formula balances accuracy (Success Rate) with activity (Total Calls).
